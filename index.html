            I am currently living in Zurich, where I grew up, and have recently successfully gotten my matura. After a gap year I have now started my studies in Computer Science at the University of ZÃ¼rich. I have many different hobbies that I'm passionate about, for example photography and filmmaking. You can check out my YouTube channel and Instagram below to see some of my work. I've also been learning to pilot FPV drones for the past couple of years, aswell as 3D Printing recently. In addition, I'm very enthusiastic about music, particularly classical and film music. I've tried playing many different instruments while growing up, and I'm playing the oboe and the piano currently.
